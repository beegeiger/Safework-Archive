<p>
	The Sex Workers Outreach Project is a national social justice network dedicated to the fundamental human rights of people involved in the sex trade and their communities, focusing on ending violence and stigma through education and advocacy. It is one of the main national sex worker support organizations. It has many different services in different places, but it is a great central resource to visit!

<h2>Sex Workers Anonymous</h2>
<h5><a href="http://www.sexworkersanonymous.com/">http://www.sexworkersanonymous.com/</a></h5>
<p>
	Sex Workers Anonymous is a program devoted to getting people out of sex work (who want to get out) and in particular, fighting human trafficking. Unfortunately, many organizations devoted to "fighting human trafficking" lobby and fight for laws that (whether on purporse or incidentally) harm consensual sex workers who AREN'T trying to get out of the business. At first glance, this program seems to focus on the wellbeing of individual people they work with, but if you see evidence that they in any way harm sex workers, please let the admins know (at safeworkapp@gmail.com) and we will remove them from our resource page!
