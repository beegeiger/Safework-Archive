# Contributing to The SafeWork Project

- The SafeWork Project is a sex worker support web app built on the idea of collaboration, not just between sex workers, but also between developers wishing to aid sex workers. Developers of all levels are encouraged to contribute ideas, discussion, and the code itself. The main goal of the SafeWork Project is to aid sex workers and the site should always be growing, developing, and changing to suite the needs of the people we want to help.

- The original developer, Dorothy Bee Geiger, graduated from a bootcamp (Hackbright Academy) in mid 2018. She has ideas for the site, but is incredibly open to new approaches and ideas for it and isn't attached to any particular technique or framework. For this reason, please feel free to make suggestions or comments on any way the site can be improved!

- No matter what the issue, please always be civil (even kind) in your comments. The SafeWork Project encourages developers of all levels (and not just experienced experts) to contribute and people should not be scared or intimidated from contributing because they are missing some area of knowlege. Ideally the SafeWork Project can be a platform to aid developers in learning as well as its ultimate goal of helping sex workers.

## Issues

- If you see an issue not already included, create a new issue with as much description and documentation as possible.

- If you see a potential error or improvement to a current issue, make a comment on it to start a discussion

- If you think of a big feature/change for the project, feel free to suggest it in a new issue, but don't feel discouraged if others don't agree on it's importance, priority, or implementation. At this stage in the SafeWork Project's development, discussion on the direction, goals, and implementation of the app is very much encouraged. It's better to have many ideas to pick from than for people to feel like their ideas need to be perfect/fully developed.

## Pull Requests

- Before spending much time working on a pull request, please comment on your interest (and ask any questions you have) in the issue and you will be assigned to work on the issue.

### Testing

- Ideally, every aspect of the web app should be fully tested at any given time. Right now, the site is not yet fully tested, so adding tests is a top priority.

- If you make any changes/improvements to the site, please also include testing for it (now located in tests.py). If for some reason you can't add testing, please comment on the issue and your pull request so others know what tests need to be added. If you do add tests, please also add a small comment saying so.

- If you see something untested that isn't included in an issue, please feel free to add an issue, make a comment, or make a pull request with the updated tests.

### Documentation

- Everything in the app should have clear documentation. Dorothy Bee is working on that for the existing code, so do your best to add documentation for any new/changed code that you write! If you have any questions or need help, comment in the issue!
